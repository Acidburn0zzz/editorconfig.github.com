  <h2 id="what-is-editorconfig">What is EditorConfig?</h2>

  <p>EditorConfig is an initiative for solving the <q>my coding style is different than yours</q> problem common amongst multi-developer teams.  An EditorConfig file is used to define recommended coding styles for groups of files.  The goal of this project is to finalize the EditorConfig file format and create plugins to add EditorConfig support to popular text editors and <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDEs</abbr>.</p>

<section id="file-format">

  <h2>What's an EditorConfig file look like?</h2>

  <p>The EditorConfig file format is not yet finalized.  This is the definition for the current editorconfig version pending finalization (v0.3).</p>

  <section id="example-file">
    <h3>Example file</h3>
    <p>The below file specifies that all files with a <code>py</code> file extension (Python files) use 4 spaces for indentation and all files with a <code>js</code> file extension (JavaScript files) use hard tabs for indentation with a column width of 2 (appearing the same width as 2 characters).</p>

    <pre>
root = true

[*.py]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

[*.js]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 2
</pre>
  </section>

  <section id="file-location">
    <h3>Where are these files stored?</h3>

    <p>When a file is opened in a text editor with an EditorConfig plugin, a search is performed in the current directory and all parent directories for a file called <code>.editorconfig</code>.  All found EditorConfig files are searched for sections with section names matching the current filename.  The search will stop if an EditorConfig file is found with the <code>root</code> property set to <code>true</code> or when reaching the root filesystem directory.</p>

    <p>Files are read top to bottom and the most recent rules found take precedence.  If multiple <code>.editorconfig</code> files have matching sections, the rules from the closer <code>.editorconfig</code> file are read last, so properties in closer files take precedence.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="file-format-details">
    <h3>Details of the file format</h3>

    <p>EditorConfig files use an INI file format in which section names are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)">globs</a> matching filenames in a format accepted by the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fnmatch">fnmatch</a> C library.  Comments can be added to these files by prepending a semicolon (<code>;</code>) to the beginning of a line.  Comments and blank lines are ignored when parsing these files.</p>

    <p>Filename globs containing path separators (<code>/</code>) match filepaths as expected.  For example <code>src/*.c</code> matches all <code>*.c</code> files directly below <code>src</code> directories.  Filename globs starting with a path separator match the path starting from the <code>.editorconfig</code> file only.  For example <code>/*.c</code> matches only C files in the directory of the found <code>.editorconfig</code> file.</p>

    <p>EditorConfig files should be UTF-8 encoded.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="wildcards">
    <h4>Wildcard patterns</h4>

    <p>Section names in EditorConfig files are filename globs that support pattern matching through Unix shell-style wildcards.  These filename globs recognize the following as special characters for wildcard matching:</p>

    <table>
      <tr><td><code>*</code></td><td>Matches any string of characters, except for path separators (<code>/</code> character)</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>**</code></td><td>Matches any string of characters</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>?</code></td><td>Matches any single character</td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>[seq]</code></td><td>Matches any single character in <i>seq</i></td></tr>
      <tr><td><code>[!seq]</code></td><td>Matches any single character not in <i>seq</i></td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>The backslash character (<code>\</code>) can be used to escape a character so it is not interpreted as a special character.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="supported-properties">
    <h4>Supported properties</h4>
    <p>EditorConfig file sections contain properties, which are name-value pairs separated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>).  EditorConfig plugins will ignore unrecognized property names and properties with invalid values.</p>

    <p>Here is the list of all property names understood by EditorConfig and all valid values for these properties:</p>

    <ul class="property-definitions">
      <li><dfn>indent_style</dfn>: set to <q>tab</q> or <q>space</q> to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively.</li>
      <li><dfn>indent_size</dfn>: a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported).</li>
      <li><dfn>tab_width</dfn>: a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character.  This defaults to the value of <strong>indent_size</strong> and should not usually need to be specified.</li>
      <li><dfn>end_of_line</dfn>: set to <q>LF</q>, <q>CR</q>, or <q>CRLF</q> to control how line breaks are represented.</li>
      <li><dfn>root</dfn>: special property that should be specified at the top of the file outside of any sections.  Set to <q>true</q> to stop <code>.editorconfig</code> files search on current file.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Property names are case insensitive and all property names are lowercased when parsing.  The values of the <strong>indent_style</strong> and <strong>end_of_line</strong> properties are also case insensitive and are lowercased when parsing.</p>
  </section>

<section id="supported-editors">

  <h2>Supported text editors</h2>

  <p>The EditorConfig file format is not finalized yet, but there are already plugins for some popular text editors.</p>

  <p>Plugins are currently available for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-vim">Vim</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-emacs">Emacs</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-gedit">Gedit</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig-notepad-plus-plus">Notepad++</a></li>
  </ul>
    <p>Eventually the file format will be finalized and plugins will be written for other popular text editors.</p>

  <section id="feedback">
    <h3>Give us your feedback</h3>

    <p>This project is greatly in need of feedback from other developers.  We want to hear ideas about how to make this project better.  Please use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/editorconfig">mailing list</a> to send an email to the editorconfig team and use the <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/issues">issue tracker</a> to submit bugs.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="create-a-plugin">
    <h3>Create a plugin</h3>

    <p>EditorConfig plugins can be developed by using the EditorConfig core code found in the <a href="https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig">EditorConfig core repository</a>.  The EditorConfig core is a C program that accepts as input the file being edited, finds and parses applicable <code>.editorconfig</code> files, and passes back the properties that should be used.</p>
    <p>If you are planning on creating a new plugin, use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/editorconfig">mailing list</a> to let us know so we can help out and link to your plugin once it's online.  If you plan on using the EditorConfig core as a C library or command line interface, the <a href="core-docs">documentation</a> may be helpful.</p>
